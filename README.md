# What is Discord Neutron ?
Discord Neutron is a theme meant to improve your experience. Discord Neutron is made to be highly customizable and even more compact. The theme has been updated to support Discord's lastests updates, I also made a few fixes just an hour later! You can easily change the theme's colors using HEX or RGB.

use the custom css editor in Better discord
you can find color variants in the "other colors" folder, just copy the hex codes

    /* Wallpaper */
    .layer-3QrUeG {
          background-image: url("IMAGE URL") !important;
    }
    /* Home button image */
    .guildInner-3DSoA4 a svg {
        background-image: url("IMAGE URL");
